# (2023/2024) and (2024/2025) Advanced Computer Architectures

The notes are taken from the books required for the course: 

- J.L. Hennessy and D.A. Patterson. *Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach.* ISSN. Elsevier Science, 2017

You can view/download the PDF [here](notes/advanced-computer-architectures.pdf). In the [notes folder](notes/), you can also see the source code.

I also made a [simple formulary](notes/formulary.pdf) to take to the exam.

For any issue, [use the appropriate section](https://github.com/PoliMI-HPC-E-notes-projects-AndreVale69/HPC-E-PoliMI-university-notes/issues).
