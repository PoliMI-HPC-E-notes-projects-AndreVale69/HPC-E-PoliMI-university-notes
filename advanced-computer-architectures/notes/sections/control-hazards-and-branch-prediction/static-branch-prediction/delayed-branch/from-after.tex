\paragraph{From After}\label{paragraph: From After}

The ``From After'' scheduling technique is \textbf{rarely used because it is too complex to be practical}. However, in the \definitionWithSpecificIndex{``From After''}{Delayed Branch Scheduling: From After}{} strategy, the \textbf{instruction} scheduled in the \textbf{branch delay slot} is \textbf{taken} from a later point the the code, specifically, from \textbf{after the fall-through instruction}.

\highspace
Let's number the instructions to make it easy:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=riscv, mathescape=true]
Instr A     # Before branch
Branch      # Branch condition
Instr B     # PC + 4 (fall-through)
Instr C     # After fall-through $\leftarrow \text{from after}$
Instr D
\end{lstlisting}
In ``from after'', the compiler \textbf{moves \texttt{Instr C} into the delay slot}, even though \texttt{Instr B (PC + 4)} should come right after the branch in normal execution (if not taken).

To safely move \texttt{Instr C} up into the delay slot, the \textbf{compiler must guarantee}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \important{No Data Dependency Conflicts}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{Instr C} must not use or modify data that depends on \texttt{Instr A}, \texttt{B}, or the branch outcome. For example, if \texttt{Instr C} uses a value computed in \texttt{Instr B}, moving it before \texttt{Instr B} causes incorrect results.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \important{Safe if Executed Early}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Even if the branch is taken and \texttt{Instr C} should never execute, now it always executes in the delay slot.
        \item So \texttt{Instr C} must be safe to execute even when it's not needed.
        \item We call this a \emph{speculatively safe instruction}.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \important{No Control Flow Violation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If \texttt{Instr C} should only run after a condition is met, moving it earlier might break program logic.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
