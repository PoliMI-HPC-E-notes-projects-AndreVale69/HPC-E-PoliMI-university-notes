\section{GPGPU Computing}

Since the GPU aspects have been thoroughly covered in the Parallel Computing course, we provide a link to the PDF and invite anyone to refer to the notes. The slides used in this course are the same as those used in the Parallel Computing course, so the notes are reliable.
