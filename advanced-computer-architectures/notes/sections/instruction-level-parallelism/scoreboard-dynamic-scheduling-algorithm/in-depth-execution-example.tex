\subsubsection{In-Depth Execution Example}

The goal of this section is to observe how the scoreboard manages dependencies, tracks resource usage, and handles all threats over time using an example.

    \textcolor{Green3}{\faIcon{star} \textbf{Initial Setup: Instruction List and Dependencies}}
\end{flushleft}
The instructions are:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=riscv]
LD    F6, 34(R2)
LD    F2, 45(R3)
MULTD F0, F2, F4      # RAW on F2
SUBD  F8, F6, F2      # RAW on F6, F2
DIVD  F10, F0, F6     # RAW on F0, F6
ADDD  F6, F8, F2      # WAW & WAR on F6, RAW on F8 & F2
\end{lstlisting}
We have a mix of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item RAW hazards: \texttt{F2}, \texttt{F6}, \texttt{F0}, \texttt{F8}
    \item WAW/WAR: around register \texttt{F6}
\end{itemize}
During the example, we will show the status of three main hardware data structures introduced in the section \ref{subsubsection: Scoreboard Data Structures}, page \pageref{subsubsection: Scoreboard Data Structures}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Instruction Status Table}: tracks the lifecycle state of each instruction in the pipeline.
    \item \textbf{Functional Unit Status Table}: tracks the usage and readiness of each functional unit (FU), and the dependency state of the operands.
    \item \textbf{Register Result Status Table}: tracks which FU is \textbf{scheduled to write} to each floating-point register.
\end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Cycle \theenumi}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[\textcolor{Green3}{\faIcon{check}}] \texttt{MULTD F0, F2, F4} is issued to \texttt{Mult1}.
        \item[\textcolor{Red2}{\faIcon{times}}] \textbf{RAW hazard} on \texttt{F2}: operand not yet available (second load not completed).

        \item \texttt{LD F2} is executing (started in Cycle 5).
    \end{itemize}
    Highlights:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[\textcolor{Green3}{\faIcon{check}}] \texttt{MULTD} \textbf{is issued} because: the \texttt{Mult1} functional unit is free (no structural hazard), and no other instruction is writing to \texttt{F0} (no WAW hazard).
        \item[\textcolor{Red2}{\faIcon{times}}] But execution (of \texttt{MULTD}) is blocked because:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \texttt{F2} (a source operand) is still being loaded by \texttt{LD F2}, and this is a RAW (Read After Write) hazard.
            \item \texttt{MULTD} must \textbf{wait until} \texttt{LD F2} \textbf{writes its result into register} \texttt{F2}.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item[\textcolor{Green3}{\faIcon{check}}] \texttt{DIVD F10, F0, F62} is \textbf{issued} to \texttt{Divide} unit (free).
        \item[\textcolor{Green3}{\faIcon{check}}] \texttt{LD F2} \textbf{writes back to} \texttt{F2}, now \texttt{MULTD} and \texttt{SUBD} can read \texttt{F2} (cycle 9).
        \item[\textcolor{Red2}{\faIcon{times}}] But execution is blocked because:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item It needs \texttt{F0} (being written by \texttt{MULTD}), so \textbf{RAW hazard} on \texttt{F0}.
            \item It also uses \texttt{F6}, which is already ready.
            \item \texttt{F2} just finished loading and is \textbf{not yet written back} (this cycle), so still blocked (\textbf{RAW hazard}).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    This stage shows \textbf{cascading dependency chains} forming: \texttt{DIVD} waits for \texttt{MULTD}, which waits for \texttt{LD F2}.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item[\textcolor{Green3}{\faIcon{check}}] \texttt{SUBD} writes result to \texttt{F8}
        \item[\textcolor{Green3}{\faIcon{check}}] The \texttt{Add} \textbf{unit becomes available} again.

        \item \texttt{DIVD} still waiting for \texttt{F0}.
        \item \texttt{ADDD} can now potentially be issued, since the \texttt{Add} \textbf{unit is no longer busy}.

    \textbf{Hazard check}: the \textbf{WAW hazard on} \texttt{F6} (from \texttt{ADDD}) is now \textbf{clear} because no one is writing to \texttt{F6} at this moment.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item \texttt{DIVD} is supposed to read \texttt{F6}, but \texttt{ADDD} wants to write it.
            \item \texttt{ADDD} must wait until \texttt{DIVD} reads \texttt{F6} to avoid overwriting it too early.

    \textbf{Classic WAR hazard}: writer (\texttt{ADDD}) must not overwrite a register untile readers (\texttt{DIVD}) finish reading it.

    \item \textbf{Cycle \theenumi}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Again, same situation:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \texttt{ADDD} is \textbf{still waiting} to write \texttt{F6} (WAR hazard).
            \item \texttt{DIVD} is still blocked from reading \texttt{F0} (pending from \texttt{MULTD}).
        \end{itemize}
        \item \texttt{MULTD} completes execution (latency ends here)
    \end{itemize}
    Now the scoreboard is ready for \texttt{MULTD} to write its result.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Recall: \texttt{DIVD} was issued in cycle 8, and with a long latency (40 cycles), it finally ends execution here.
        \end{itemize}
        \item The scoreboard marks the \texttt{Divide} functional unit as \textbf{ready to write}.
    \end{itemize}
    This shows how the scoreboard tracks long-latency FUs \textbf{without blocking the pipeline}. Other instructions have long since finished.

The 62-cycle examle is a demonstration of: efficient hazard management, robust scheduling logic, clean and scalable hardware coordination. The scoreboard shines in showing how \textbf{simple rules, carefully enforced, can deliver powerful out-of-order behavior} without complexity of modern speculative or superscalar techniques.
