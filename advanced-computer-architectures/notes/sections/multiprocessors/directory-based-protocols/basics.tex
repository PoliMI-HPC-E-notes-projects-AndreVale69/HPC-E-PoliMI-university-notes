\subsection{Directory-Based Protocols}

\subsubsection{Basics}

The \definition{Directory-Based Protocol} is a cache coherence protocol that \hl{uses a centralized directory to keep track of the state of each memory block in a multiprocessor system}. The directory maintains information about which caches have copies of each memory block and their states (e.g., modified, shared, invalid).

\highspace
Unlike snooping protocols (which rely on broadcast), directory protocols \textbf{store the sharing state of each memory block in a single, well-defined location}, called \important{directory}.

\end{flushleft}
The \textbf{directory is hardware}, not an OS software structure. It is a \textbf{table maintained in hardware} inside the \textbf{memory controller of each node}. We can think of it as a \textbf{metadata} attached to each memory block.

\highspace
In a \textbf{Distributed Shared-Memory (DSM)} system (more common in scalable multiprocessors), each memory module has its \textbf{own directory} stored next to it. So if a block resides in memory node \texttt{N0}, the directory for that block is in node \texttt{N0}'s memory controller.

\end{flushleft}
The directory keeps track of the \textbf{state of each memory block} and which nodes have cached copies of it. Directory keeps track of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \important{coherence state} of the block (Uncached, Shared, Modified):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{U (Uncached)}: No cache has a copy of the block. Only the memory copy is valid (up-to-date).
        \item \textbf{S (Shared)}: One or more caches may have it in read-only mode (because they issued a read request). Memory copy is still valid (\textbf{up-to-date}).
        \item \textbf{M (Modified)}: One cache has a read-write copy of the block (the owner). Memory copy is \textbf{stale} (out-of-date).
    \end{itemize}
    These are conceptually analogous to the states in the MSI protocol (page \pageref{fig: msi-finite-state-machine}), but tracked centrally\footnote{%
        With ``\emph{centrally}'' we mean that the directory has a global view of the state of each block, whereas in a distributed cache system, each cache would need to manage its own state independently.
    } in the directory rather than in each cache.

    \item A \important{sharer list}. It is usually implemented as a \textbf{bit vector} (one bit per node). If the bit node \emph{i} is \texttt{1}, it means node \emph{i}'s cache currently has a valid \textbf{shared copy} of that block. If the bit is \texttt{0}, node \emph{i} does not cache that block.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{U state (Uncached)}: sharer list is all zeros.
        \item \textbf{S state (Shared)}: sharer list may have several bits set to \texttt{1}.
        \item \textbf{M state (Modified)}: sharer list will have exactly one bit set to \texttt{1} (the owner).
    \end{itemize}

    \item The \important{owner} of the block (if it is in the \emph{Modified} state).

    \textcolor{Green3}{\faIcon{question-circle} \textbf{Since the owner field is filled only in the Modified state, and the share list contains only one bit set to 1 in the Modified state, why do we need both?}} From a pure information theory point of view, the owner field is redundant. However, having a \textbf{dedicated owner field can simplify and speed up} certain operations, such as identifying the owner quickly without scanning the sharer list. This can be particularly useful in large systems where efficiency is critical.
\end{itemize}
So, in a DSM system, \hl{each node has its own local memory and a directory that tracks all the blocks physically mapped to that memory}. For example, the node \texttt{N0} has a directory that tracks all the blocks physically stored in its local memory and keeps track of which nodes have cached copies of those blocks.

\highspace
This allows \textbf{point-to-point messaging} (no broadcast), which is essential for scalability in large multiprocessor systems (DSM, page \pageref{sec:DSM}).

    \textcolor{Green3}{\faIcon{users} \textbf{Roles of Nodes}}
\end{flushleft}
In a directory-based protocol, nodes can take on different roles based on their interaction with memory blocks. For nodes that participate in a coherence transaction, we have \textbf{three roles}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[\important{\faIcon{home}}] \important{Home Node (H)}: the node that \textbf{``owns'' the memory block} (fixed by the physical address mapping). Stores both the \textbf{block in memory} and its \textbf{directory entry}. All requests for this block must eventually pass through its directory.
    \item[\important{\faIcon{location-arrow}}] \important{Local Node (L)}: the node where the \textbf{request originates}. For example, CPU at node \texttt{N2} issues a read miss, then its cache controller is the local requester.
    \item[\important{\faIcon{globe}}] \important{Remote Node (R)}: a node that \textbf{already has a cached copy} of thee block. (either \emph{Shared} or \emph{Modified}). If the copy is \emph{Modified}, the most updated value resides there (not in the home memory), but the home directory knows which node is the owner and can request the updated value from it.
\end{itemize}
Obviously, for a given transaction, a node can take on multiple roles. For example, the local requester can also be a home node if it is requesting a block that it owns.
