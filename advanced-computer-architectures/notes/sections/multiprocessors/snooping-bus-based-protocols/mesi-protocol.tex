\subsubsection{MESI Protocol}

The \definition{MESI Protocol} appeared in the early 1980s, notably with the Intel 486 (1989) being one of the first commercial CPUs to implement MESI. It was a natural refinement of MSI, created by \textbf{computer architects studying snooping coherence} for scalable multiprocessors. The design goal: reduce \textbf{bus contention}, improve \textbf{latency of private writes}, and keep protocols \textbf{simple enough for hardware implementation}.

\end{flushleft}
In MSI, whenever a processor brings a block into the cache after a \textbf{Read Miss}, it always goes to \textbf{Shared (S)}, even if no one else has that block (see FSM diagram, page \pageref{fig: msi-finite-state-machine}). But in that case, the cache \emph{knows} it is the only copy (because the bus transaction didn't see any sharer response). Yet, MSI still marks it as ``Shared'', which forces:
\begin{itemize}
    \item An unnecessary \textbf{Invalidate} on the next write (wasting bandwidth). Because the block is in state S (shared), the \hl{next write must issue a trigger to invalidate other caches}, even though there are no other caches with that block.
    \item Extra latency before the processor can write. Because the block is in state S (shared), the \hl{next write must wait for the Invalidate to complete before it can proceed}, even though there are no other caches with that block.
\end{itemize}
So MSI wasted both \textbf{bandwidth} (spurious invalidations) and \textbf{time} (delayed private writes).

    \textcolor{Green3}{\faIcon[regular]{lightbulb} \textbf{MESI Solution}}
\end{flushleft}
To solve this problem, MESI adds a new state called \textbf{Exclusive (E)}. The key idea is that when a processor brings a block into the cache after a \emph{Read Miss}, it can go to state \textbf{Exclusive (E)} if \emph{no other cache has that block}. This capture the common case:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Most memory blocks are private} (i.e., not shared). For example, stack data and many heap objects are private to a single thread; or local variables in a function are private to that function; or unique data structures used by a single thread are private to that thread.
    \item \textbf{If a block is private and clean, the cache should not need to notify other caches on a write}. Instead, it can silently transition to \emph{Modified (M)} without any bus transaction. This saves both bandwidth (no spurious invalidations) and time (no delayed writes).
\end{itemize}
Thus, \emph{Read Misses} can go to state \textbf{Exclusive (E)} if no other cache has that block, and then the next write can transition to \textbf{Modified (M)} without any bus transaction (silently). \hl{This optimization is the main benefit of MESI over MSI}.

    \textcolor{Green3}{\faIcon{stream} \textbf{MESI States}}
\end{flushleft}
MESI has four states:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Modified (M)}: The cache line is present only in the current cache and has been modified (is dirty). Memory is stale.
    \item \textbf{Exclusive (E)}: The cache line is present only in the current cache and is clean (matches memory). The cache can silently transition to \emph{Modified (M)} on a write.
    \item \textbf{Shared (S)}: The cache line may be present in other caches and is clean (matches memory).
    \item \textbf{Invalid (I)}: The cache line is not valid (not present in the cache).
\end{itemize}

The MESI protocol modifies some transitions from MSI and adds new ones:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{On a Read Miss}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If no other cache responds, we need to fetch from memory $\rightarrow$ \textbf{E} (instead of S in MSI).
        \item If some cache responds $\rightarrow$ \textbf{S}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{On a Write Hit}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{S} $\to$ \textbf{M} with bus invalidate (same as MSI).
        \item \textbf{E} $\to$ \textbf{M} silently (no bus invalidate).
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{On snooped requests}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{E} $\to$ \textbf{S} if another processor reads.
        \item \textbf{E} $\to$ \textbf{I} if another processor writes.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

    \textcolor{Green3}{\faIcon{question-circle} \textbf{When to Write Back to Memory?}}
\end{flushleft}
In MESI, a cache \textbf{writes back to memory only when evicting a dirty block}, i.e. when a line in \textbf{M (Modified)} is replaced or must be supplied to another core.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Eviction of an M line}. If the cache needs to evict a line in \textbf{Modified (M)}, it must \textbf{write it back to memory} (because memory is stale). Transition from M $\to$ I, with write-back.
    \item \textbf{Snooped Read Miss while in M}. Another processor requests the line. Our cache supplies the data (since memory is stale). Transition from M $\to$ S, with write-back.
    \item \textbf{Snooped Write Miss / Invalidate while in M}. Another processor wants ownership of the line. Our cache must \textbf{write back the block to memory} before invalidating its copy. Transition from M $\to$ I, with write-back.
\end{itemize}
There is absolutely no need to write back to memory when transitioning from \textbf{E (Exclusive)}, \textbf{S (Shared)}, or \textbf{I (Invalid)} states, since these states are clean (memory is up-to-date) or invalid (not present in cache). In other words, \textbf{the only time a write-back is needed is when evicting a dirty block in M state}.
