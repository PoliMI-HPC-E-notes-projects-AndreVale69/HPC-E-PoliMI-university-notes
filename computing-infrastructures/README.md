- **Hardware infrastructure of datacenters**:
    - Basic components, Rack structure, Cooling
    - Hard Disk Drive and Solid State Disks
    - RAID architectures
    - Hardware Accelerators
- **Software infrastructure of datacenters**:
    - Virtualization: basic concepts, technologies, hypervisors and containers
    - Computing Architecture: Cloud, Edge and Fog Computing
- Infrastructure-, platform- and software-as-a-service
- **Methods**:
    - Scalability and performance of datacenters: definitions, fundamental laws, queuing network theory basics
    - Reliability and availability of datacenters: definitions, fundamental laws, reliability block diagrams
- Exercises to apply the knowledge in simple examples or to more complicated scenarios will be used especially considering the parts related to reliability, storage system design, and performance analysis.
