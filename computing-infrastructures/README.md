# (2023/2024) and (2024/2025) Computing Infrastructures

These notes are an unofficial resource and shouldn't replace the course material or any other book on _computing infrastructure_. It is not made for commercial purposes. I've made the following notes to help me improve my knowledge and maybe it can be helpful for everyone.

As I have highlighted, a student should choose the teacher's material or a book on the topic. These notes can only be a helpful material.

The notes are taken from the books required for the course: 

- L.A. Barroso, U. HÃ¶lzle, and P. Ranganathan. _The Datacenter as a Computer: Designing Warehouse-Scale Machines, Third Edition_. Synthesis Lectures on Computer Architecture. Springer International Publishing, 2022.
- E.D. Lazowska. _Quantitative System Performance: Computer System Analysis Using Queueing Network Models_. Prentice-Hall, 1984.
- Course slides.

You can view/download the PDF [here](notes/computing-infrastructures.pdf). In the [notes folder](notes/), you can also see the source code.

In the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) file you can see the changes made to each version of the PDF file. The versioning can be helpful if you want to understand if there are any new features/fixes in the file.

For any issue, [use the appropriate section](https://github.com/PoliMI-HPC-E-notes-projects-AndreVale69/HPC-E-PoliMI-university-notes/issues).

- **Hardware infrastructure of datacenters**:
    - Basic components, Rack structure, Cooling
    - Hard Disk Drive and Solid State Disks
    - RAID architectures
    - Hardware Accelerators
- **Software infrastructure of datacenters**:
    - Virtualization: basic concepts, technologies, hypervisors and containers
    - Computing Architecture: Cloud, Edge and Fog Computing
- Infrastructure-, platform- and software-as-a-service
- **Methods**:
