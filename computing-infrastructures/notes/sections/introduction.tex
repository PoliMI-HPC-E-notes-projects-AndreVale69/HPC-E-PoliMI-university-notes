\section{Data Center and Computing Infrastructure}

There's no single definition of a Data Center, but it can be summarized as follows.

\begin{definitionbox}[: Data Center]\label{Data Center definition}
    \definition{Data Center}s are buildings where multiple servers and communications equipment are co-located for common environmental requirements, physical security, and ease of maintenance.\cite{barroso2022datacenter}
\end{definitionbox}

\begin{definitionbox}[: Computing Infrastructure]
    A \definition{Computing Infrastructure} (or IT Infrastructure) is a technological infrastructure that provides hardware and software for computation to other systems and services.
\end{definitionbox}

\noindent
Traditional data centres have the following characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Host a large number} of relatively small or medium sized \textbf{applications};
    
    \item Each \textbf{application is running on a dedicated HW infrastructure} that is de-coupled and protected from other systems in the same facility;
    
    \item \textbf{Applications tend not to communicate each other}.
\end{itemize}
Those \textbf{data centers host} hardware and software \textbf{for multiple organizational units} or even \textbf{different companies}.
