# (2024/2025) Network Computing

These notes are an unofficial resource and shouldn't replace the course material or any other book on _network computing_. It is not made for commercial purposes. I've made the following notes to help me improve my knowledge and maybe it can be helpful for everyone.

As I have highlighted, a student should choose the teacher's material or a book on the topic. These notes can only be a helpful material.
