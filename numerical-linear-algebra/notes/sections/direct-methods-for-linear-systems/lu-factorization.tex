\section{Direct Methods for Linear Systems}

This section provides a brief introduction to direct methods for linear systems of equations.

\subsection{LU Factorization}

\definition{LU Factorization} is a \textbf{method} used in numerical linear algebra \textbf{to decompose a square matrix $A$ into two factors}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A lower unitary triangular matrix $L$;
    \item An upper triangular matrix $U$, such that $A = LU$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textcolor{Green3}{\textbf{Principal Submatrices}}. Let $A_{p,i} \in \mathbb{R}^{i,i}, i = 1, \dots, n$ be the principal submatrices of $A$ obtained by considering the first $i$ rows and columns. These submatrices are \textbf{crucial in determining the existence of an LU factorization}.

    \item \textcolor{Green3}{\textbf{Determinant Condition}}. For LU factorization to be possible, the determinant of each principal submatrix must be non-zero:
    \begin{equation*}
        \det(A_{p,i}) \neq 0 \hspace{2em} \forall i = 1, \ldots, n-1
    \end{equation*}

    \item \textcolor{Green3}{\textbf{LU Factorization Theorem}}. \begin{theorem}
        If $A$ is invertible, then it admits an LU factorization if and only if all its leading principal minors\footnote{%
            A \definition{Leading Principal Minor} is the determinant of a top-left submatrix of $A$.
            
            For a square matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The first leading principal minor is the determinant of the $1 \times 1$ submatrix that includes only the first element of $A$:
                \begin{equation*}
                    \Delta_1 = \det(A_{1,1})
                \end{equation*}

                \item The second leading principal minor is the determinant of the $2 \times 2$ submatrix that includes the first two rows and columns of $A$:
                \begin{equation*}
                    \Delta_2 = \det\left(\begin{pmatrix}
                        a_{11} & a_{12} \\
                        a_{21} & a_{22}
                    \end{pmatrix}\right)
                \end{equation*}

                \item The $k$-th leading principal minor is the determinant of the $k \times k$ submatrix that includes the first $k$ rows and columns of $A$:
                \begin{equation*}
                    \Delta_k = \det(A_{1:k, 1:k})
                \end{equation*}
                This pattern continues until $k = n$, where $n$ is the size of the matrix $A$.
            \end{itemize}
        } are nonzero.
