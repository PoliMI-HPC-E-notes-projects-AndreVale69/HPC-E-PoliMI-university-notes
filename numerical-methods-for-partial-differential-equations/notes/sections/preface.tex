\section*{Preface}

Every theory section in these notes has been taken from the sources:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Course slides.\cite{numerical-methods-for-partial-differential-equations-polimi}
\end{itemize}
About:

These notes are an unofficial resource and shouldn't replace the course material or any other book on numerical methods for partial differential equations. It is not made for commercial purposes. I've made the following notes to help me improve my knowledge and maybe it can be helpful for everyone.

As I have highlighted, a student should choose the teacher's material or a book on the topic. These notes can only be a helpful material.

For the laboratory, I created a simple repository containing all the code implementations and \texttt{CMake} files necessary to compile the code in a CLion environment:
