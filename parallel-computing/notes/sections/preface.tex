These notes are an unofficial resource and shouldn't replace the course material or any other book on parallel computing. It is not made for commercial purposes. I've made the following notes to help me improve my knowledge and maybe it can be helpful for everyone.

As I have highlighted, a student should choose the teacher's material or a book on the topic. These notes can only be a helpful material.

During the Parallel Computing for HPC course, me and my other two colleagues \href{https://it.linkedin.com/in/javedabdullah}{Abdullah Javed} and Alberto Ondei, we created two projects:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[\faIcon{github}] \href{https://github.com/PoliMI-HPC-E-notes-projects-AndreVale69/Parallel-Computing-Challenges}{Parallel Merge Sort \& CUDA 2D Convolution}
