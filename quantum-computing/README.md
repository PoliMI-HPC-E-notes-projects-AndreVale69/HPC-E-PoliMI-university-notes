# (2024/2025) Quantum Computing

These notes are an unofficial resource and shouldn't replace the course material or any other book on _quantum computing_. It is not made for commercial purposes. I've made the following notes to help me improve my knowledge and maybe it can be helpful for everyone.

As I have highlighted, a student should choose the teacher's material or a book on the topic. These notes can only be a helpful material.

You can view/download the PDF [here](notes/quantum-computing.pdf). In the [notes folder](notes/), you can also see the source code.

In the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) file you can see the changes made to each version of the PDF file. The versioning can be helpful if you want to understand if there are any new features/fixes in the file.

For any issue, [use the appropriate section](https://github.com/PoliMI-HPC-E-notes-projects-AndreVale69/HPC-E-PoliMI-university-notes/issues).
