# (2023/2024) Software Engineering for HPC

These notes are an unofficial resource and shouldn't replace the course material or any other book on software engineering. It is not made for commercial purposes. I've made the following notes to help me improve my knowledge and maybe it can be helpful for everyone.

As I have highlighted, a student should choose the teacher's material or a book on the topic. These notes can only be a helpful material.

The notes are taken from the books required for the course: 

- Course slides.

You can view/download the PDF [here](notes/software-engineering-for-hpc.pdf). In the [notes folder](notes/), you can also see the source code.

For any issue, [use the appropriate section](https://github.com/PoliMI-HPC-E-notes-projects-AndreVale69/HPC-E-PoliMI-university-notes/issues).
